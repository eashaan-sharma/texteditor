Code Explanation
The project uses Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a breakdown:

Main Window:
The Tk() class creates the main application window.
Text Widget:
The Text widget allows users to type and edit text.
Save Function:
A file dialog (asksaveasfilename) lets users save their text input to a file.
Font Menu:
The Menu widget creates a dropdown menu with font options.
The text font is updated dynamically using the config() method.



Dependencies
This project relies on Python's standard libraries:
Tkinter (for GUI)
filedialog (for save file functionality)



Future (maybe):
Open File Functionality: Add a feature to open and edit existing text files.
Text Formatting: Include options like Bold, Italics, and Underline.
Theme Support: Add light and dark mode options for the editor.
